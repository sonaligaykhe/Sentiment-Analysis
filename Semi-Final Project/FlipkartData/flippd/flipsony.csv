"light weight Pen Drive.Transfer rate is good,
Pen Drive..
29.1 GB available space(FAT)
29.0 GB available space(NTFS)
Small and compact..
performance not so impressive but average ...For copying a 18.1gb movie file ..avg speed:4.4mb/sec(apprx)
But under this price the pen drive is Very good
Thanks Flipkart for making available this beautiful pen drive.",,,,
"Good quality and speed ,
Value for money and Flipkart is cheaper than the market to buy.",,,,
"Its Transfer rate is so awesome reaches 45Mbps...
but in this PD u get only 29.1Gb of usage, so this is only low-point of this
other ways its having a plastic body.
which can even break if tossed hard with ground.
but if by-mistakely fallen, nothing will happen to it.
If you are a SONY fan
then this is the best option for you",,,,

"Buy this piece of _ if you are fascinated by the 32 gigs space, else there is nothing worth spending for in this product.
Poor performance in terms of write and read speed.
Gets recognized by the system very slow, lags the data while copying.
If you doubt my system capabilities, note that I tested this product on alienware.
If your money is hard earned then please it's a request don't buy this.
Go for HP or Sandisk.
Give a thumbs up if you found this review of some worth.",,,,
"The build quality of this pen drive is very poor. With in 6 months of lite usage, the retractable tab failed. The retractable tab is not getting locked and I need to hold the tab tightly with my thumb to insert into USB port. After that with in few days, the outer plastic case got cracked. Next time I will choose a metallic one.",,,,

"i have recently purchased this item on flipkart, its good under this price. Although writing speed could have been better, but none the less its a very good pen drive.",,,,
I received the product on Saturday 7-11-2015 in afternoon and was very well packaged. I've just formatted the drive and it seems to work OK. Only thing is out of 32 GB it is showing that only 28.8 GB is free even after formatting. There is obviously some memory which is reserved by any storage device but feel 3 GB+ is too much ! I don't know whether this is normal. But the product is made in India and very compact. Giving one star less as I am not sure that so much space is taken by res...,,,,
Good..one,,,,
