Lets Start my points:
Every one commenting about laptop perfomance But i am telling you
#Wheather its better to buy a Laptop Online or local market ?
If you r planning to buying a laptop then
You are entering in Lottery system.

"Very good Laptop.
Look - Nice

Os support - I am using Windows 7 without any problem, but you have to install wifi and usb drivers otherwise wifi and usb will not work.
Overall value for money, best in the price range, go for it.",,,,
I got it for 19990.In this price..... product is awesome....,,,,
"The display , graphics quality of this lappi is very bad and worst ……other qualities ok okk But i think display matters a lot. So.dont go for it",,,,
"After using 5 hrs continuous and installing dual boot os I found following thing's:
#Its really good performance laptop
#easily allowed to bypass UFEI and go through native MBR
#Always everything available automatically even on LinuxMint 64 bit
#Dont have Windows 7 driver support so you have to install Windows 8 or above.
#delete existing fat32 partitions and use entire HDD space.
Sounds seems lower on speaker, but never expect louder them.
Way better than Lenovo and Dell, why?
Lenovo don'...",,,,

"Great Product for home or business use. If you're looking for a laptop for home use (for multimedia, accessing internet etc) or for office use (for using tally or office based software tools for documentation). It has a decent battery for its price. I really liked its printed design on the keyboard even on the tracked. Speaking about trackpad it has clickable physical right and left buttons.

"This laptop comes with good specs but if you are not using windows 10 hardly anything will work. For instance when I installed windows 7 on it(due to the demanding nature of windows 10) nothing including ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth or USB were working. The only think functional was a DVD drive.
