Very nice product.,,,,
The best laptab ever made,,,,
I bought this laptab...... It's great .... Works best..... But one thing is that the windows installer in it is not activated..... So a little unsatisfied about this...,,,,
Product is good but windows is not getting activated. Micromax flipcart both are shouldering the responsibility on Microsoft but as key is not provided Microsoft people not able to help. Micromax customer service is too bad.,,,,
"I also bought another Asus laptop for my cousin (same price of Rs. 14999). This laptop is heavy in weight, non friendly to use. The entire keyboard stopped working within months of buying. Even their Micromax website does not mention about a dedicated service centre. Now I assume within a year, even the screen has become faulty as it has started to flicker.",,,,

Very nice product.,,,,
Worst product i ever purchased...No more 2 say don't want to waste my and your time,,,,
Truly helpful,,,,
Best in budget,,,,
....♥♥♥♥......i love it,,,,
This product is very nice to use. It's lighter and it can use as Tab as well as laptab. It's performance is good. I think micromax can have a sim slot in this product also! But it's awesome!!,,,,
The product is worth the price... But sad part is that it doesn't support 1tb external hard drive. I bought the hard drive when I saw a review stating it supports 1tb hard drive. But sadly it doesn't.,,,,
"Please dont temp for the price, better go for good product than a cheap laptab",,,,
"If you are to re install OS then you will not find drivers. Micromax customer support don't even what to do when we call them. They just ask to reset device !!..
Update 18th sep 2016
Now after using for more than 6 momths i have problem with audio. No audio working.
System hangs all of a sudden and you have only one option - force ahut down. Very frustrating.
Poor experience. Will never buy micromax products
I want my money back.
Update December 2016.
Pathetic experience at their service...",,,,
"I bought three laptab and 2 Micromax Xpress 2 Mobile all of them got stuck Windows got corrupted in all laptab and I take them to service center they install pirates Windows it ask for license key all time and you can't crack it or install it by yourself then I take it to service center again they told me there is no other solution.
1 mobile software got corrupted they install it more than 5times still same problem.
Other mobile camera stopped working and mic also stopped working centre guys ...",,,,
"This is a classic scam by the fraud company. One of the product out of 3 was defective ( Immediately filed a return request - Which was rejected by #ScamKart without a legitimate reason) The rest two worked fine for 3 days! After 3 days, the laptops wont boot. I have tried charging them for 24 hours at a stretch, they wont boot. Not only they are slow but the overall experience is hideous.",,,,
"Seriously, don't buy it. This literally uses more power than it charges, which means even when you have this plugged into a charging port and being used simultaneously, the battery would be going down and it'd shut down eventually. Crashes almost every alternate day, won't just boot at times. The keyboard packed with it looks like a toy.",,,,
"I can mention this laptop as an all in one laptop.We can use it as a tablet, laptop and can connect external drives in both mode. Don't expect too much perfomance as this product is doing more jobs at this price.",,,,
"I have purchased this laptab for its configuration but when i recieved the product i found that there is not sim slot in it. and i was very upset for that. other things are ok. but when i have to purchase a saparate dongle for internet connectivity, why i spend so much money.
All things are ok but no 3g and sim facility.",,,,
"I was looking for large screen tablet in economical range. This s perfect.Fast delivery and good packaging. Display very good. Accepted 64 GB micro sd card. sound good. video quality good. battery backup 5-8 hours. fast charging. front and back camera average.
keyboard small and ok for small documents. WIFI work well. both usb ports work well.
Cons ...

"very nice product for persons searching for low budget laptops. we can do programming like c++ , java ,etc...And can play games like GTA san andreas , need for speed ,etc.....
we can also install autocad 3ds max software in it and also play games till 2008 including gta 4 and max payne 3.I think this product will not let any of our expectations go down !!!!!",,,,
"I bought this Laptab wifi only version in Feb 2016, mainly for my ebooks and watching movies. Within two months of the purchase my main laptop (7 yrs old sony vaio) failed. Then I realized the true potential of this 2-in-1 PC. This laptab is awesome. It almost replaced my main PC. It runs Windows 10, full version and I am able to do every thing that I was doing on my Vaio. I am so glad that I went for this one instead of some stupid tablet (which would have been great for reading but pretty ...",,,,
"See, one need to understand what you are buying.. this is a lap tab in actual sense. My aim of buying this was to have a replacement for laptop. My only work on laptops was viewing or making PPT, word files and pdfs. It's doing all this. Only thing is you have to develop it's habit. Its main features are
1. Windows is preinstalled. But ms office was not there. I downloaded it for free from app store and what available to me was ms mobile. It's a miniature version of ms word. However all fea...",,,,

"Bought this product a month ago. Good product to use. No lag in speed either in PC mode or Tablet mode. The only con which I feel is the lack of quality of the keyboard. It seems it wont survive for longer time. So I am planning to purchase wireless keyboard instead of it. Apart from this, it is truly worth of buying at such a low price",,,,
awesome product and so less priza but i can buy because i dont have money and i have but i wont buy one more labtop,,,,
Using for the last one month and till date no issue. Run smoothely. Great battery bsckup. provides full computrr functionality. 2 in 1 laptop cum tablet. But very high charging time. Average camera and speakers. low storage HDD just only 32gb inbuilt. otherwise rest everything is fine.,,,,

Its a good laptap . just got what I wanted,,,,
Beautiful thing at beautiful price... Loved it..,,,,
Highly disappointed. Do not buy !,,,,
very wrost products,,,,
"Cheapest laptop available. I had been using 14 to 15inch screen over the years it will surprise you with its screen size though. Having said that, I am sure at this price tag you won't find a brand new tablet plus laptop. In tablet mode, it's great as compared to attaching it to keyboard for laptop use. Keyboard mode is crampy with plastic finish and close-knit keys. Really handy in tablet mode. Mind you, at this configuration you won't be able to play games. But remind yourself that it's che...",,,,
It is very poor product. Does not support tio external CD drive and school study material. No one should buy it for kids.,,,,
Great amazing just wow laptop,,,,

"Just wow product! Budget value LapTab! true value thing! Slim, wonderful and awesome!",,,,
"Product is good but it should have at least 3 GB RAM and 100 GB internal storage. Product is working fine and having good speed with best touch features and mist beautiful thing is it can be use as both laptop and tablet.
Thanks to Micromax for the device.",,,,

"Excellent service once again from flipkart. Micromax laptab is worth for the money. But Micromax need to look out for their after sale service which is far beyond satisfactory. Good for students. Great display. Compact, stylish. But Too low in storage capacity. Battery need to be detachable and replacable. Body build can be better and stronger. Overall a good product at a justifiable price.",,,,
Printer doesnt operate efficiently. Printing a lot of pages is an issue,,,,
Average,,,,
it's so prety,,,,
Hardware is not good,,,,
Nice product ...,,,,
"After using this laptab for like a year ,i must say that its performing very good. The best part of this is the battery backup which is surprisingly very good , one can easily watch upto 3 movies with a single charge although charging it completely takes a long time . The only drawback is that as the tab settles on the dock itself so the keyboard keeps disconnecting if you move it while using which gets annoying at times ,you have to keep it on a flat surface to type properly. Rest its a perf...",,,,
"The concept of having a detachable keyboard with usb slot is nice. One can add a portable hard drive of 1 TB as well to increase the storage. The device is sleek in looks.
The problem is with the display and capacitive touch. The resolution seems to be too high for the screesize & cannot be customized. To use the device as a tablet is not seemless. Many a times the virtual keyboard doesn't popup automatically for entering text; it has to be manually activated. The wifi keeps conking down a...",,,,
Very good...........Each n every thing,,,,
We can't install Autodesk Maya or 3dx max in it because of it is 32 bit. Minimum requirements to install Autodesk Maya or 3dx max is 64 bit of Windows version,,,,
This nat working in the day,,,,
