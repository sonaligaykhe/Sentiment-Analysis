"Was 40k when placed an order and Now it is 36k within a week time, I wonder how can a price of laptop fluctuate like the price of tomato in market?
Now you came up with exact price as 35k, then why was this sold for 40k couple of weeks back?
I was actually helping one of my relatives child (Lost 7000 (2 EMI's) for nothing) to get a lap for college purpose. I believed in Flipkart but you people cheated. Very bad.
How can you sell a product without price tag?
No proper response on customer ...",,,,

"Dell Insprion 3567 have good configuration for home use in this price range. The system is bit lagging, some time system is not responding. Its Touch pad is less sensitive compare to similar configuration of hp laptop. Dell customer support service is much better than other. It is ok to purchase this laptop .",,,,
"Windows 7 is upgraded(Crack ) to windows 10, no product key for Microsoft Office tools. Selling the old products. These things I know, I don't know what are the hidden things are Crack versions. So take care while you purchase online products.",,,,

With this ₹34999.00.Windows 10,office 16&students(only word,excel,PowerPoint and one note) original version and life time with automatic updates.One problem is that this lap is little bit of slower than same configured desktop pc.But you tollerate it with other facilities which is with this laptop.Wify, Bluetooth connection also present.In future Windows 10 may be the another successful version of Microsoft....",,,,

"Very bad product, laptop display gone defective and customer care not satisfied answers",,,,
"Do go to flipkart for buy electronic product
It's very worst product.",,,,
Window was not registered with Microsoft.. so dont purchase online as this is also not available on dell showroom aa well.,,,,
"This product is really not working as expected:
1: Touch pad is very slow also not working per touch.
2: The Windows OS 10 is much slow.
3: Processing is very very slow.
4: Really not good deal, please replace or return my money ASAP.",,,,

Very good product and prompt delivery.,,,,
"Need more improvement in your system, so that customer get proper information about product",,,,
Amazing quality lappi,,,,
"I m working with this laptop since 7 month
Very good laptop
Working very smoothly and impressive outlook
But touchpad is slow",,,,
"Overall the laptop is quite good. But there are some issues related to seller, no windows tag on the laptop. Windows 10 and MS office are genuine though. Did not receive the driver CD. Most probably the windows was installed afterwards.
Anyways if you feel that the touch pad is not working properly, the issue is not with the hardware, it is programmed to sense click on the center, and if you click on side you might not get any response. So dont get worried about that.
Screen and speaker are ...",,,,
"The performance of the laptop is seriously questionable. It lags a lot especially during multitasking even when the ram requirement is low. MS Office, which comes bundled with it also takes a lot of time to even show up the initialisation screen. The display also is too whitish and the contrast, especially in a dark setting is a pain to the eyes. Moreover, not at all suitable even for light gaming. The only positive is the keypad which is smoother than HP or Lenovo. Regret my decision to have...",,,,
"Overall it is the best laptop under 35k range. Thank u flipkart for delivering it in just two days.
First its sliver foggy night colour is awesome. Original windows 10 home, office student 2016... Battery backup is gud.
But it is slow when multi-tasking... Sometimes some apps not responding. But it is ok in this configuration.",,,,
"Not completely satisfied>> I received the yesterday Laptop without ""Free Pre Loaded MS Office Home & Student 2016"" which is mentioned in the order. Also the EMI and Interest Rate differed from Order Placed and Kotak Bank Credit Card is charging almost double interest which is showing in the Flipkart Site.",,,,
"Good laptop, Made in China, Processing is bit slow, Mouse pad not upto the mark, Ms office lifetime only includes word, excel, power point, one note. Does not have outlook and other features. Overall good for basic home use and for students. Not at all recommended for office or Multitasking or gaming purpose.",,,,
Purchased this laptop in big billion days.configuration is good but material used to make is of poor quality. It was not mention earlier that it is made in china. Received in good packing but material of body is low quality.,,,,
"Product is not ut to mark.Not suitable for business or others. Usable only for kids.
Comparison to other products available in market, rating is very low.
Only C drive given in that. No other drive available.",,,,
"Best laptop in the price range....the service of ekart logistics is the worst....
The specifications and performance is good.
The only drawback I observed is mouse pad is little bit hard and there is no antiglare display
Overall it's a very good deal",,,,
Never purchase a laptop from flipkart. They provide nothing what they promise to provide. I purchased this product and that time i was told that I will get life long student office version installed in it. They just installed office 365 in the system but its Charge able. When contacted flipkart they told please contact to Dell. They are not taking responsibility too. Biggest cheaters.,,,,

It was good but before 1month ago but Now it runs very slow i don't know why,,,,

"Purchased Dell laptop on Flipkart which said MS Office Home Student 2016 version is free with this laptop
But received MS office 365 version which is asking product activation code.
Flipkart unable to resolve. When replaced, Flipkart has sent similar laptop having no MS office Home and Student 2016
When called Dell, they are saying MS office is trial version with this laptop.
