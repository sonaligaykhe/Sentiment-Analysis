"I bought this watch from filpkart.
Delivery was awesome,
But the dial is tiny and strap is much thin than shown in the picture.
It more looks a girl's watch rather than a men watch.
I asked for return the next day but the dealer denied it.
Lets see what will happen about that.
but really dissatisfied with how the product is represented",,,,
"there is no fully satisfaction with this watch its good for ladies but not perfect for men's due to its narrow dials and strip.
width of strip n diameter of dials is narrow.",,,,
Good,,,,
Dial is too small,,,,
"Its looks small on a man's hand. its good for teenage boys or women. Its lightweight, good looking, comfortable to wear.",,,,
"Item is good under this price , i like the quality and look & feel of the watch , would recommend if that suits your budget.",,,,
"dial is very small. and with silver it looks like girls' watch. even clock is going slower by 5mins a day. really bad. men.. really dont go with this. girls, go ahead for this.",,,,
