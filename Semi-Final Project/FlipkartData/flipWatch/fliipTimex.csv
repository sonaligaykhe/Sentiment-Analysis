"i've had this beauty for 4 years now,and is one of the best watches i've had.it truly does live up to its name. i've taken it trekking,scuba diving,and rafting,and the casing has never been compromised.
However due to extreme use(maybe because of salt and fresh water damage) the leather strap has been damaged a bit.(maybe that's just me...) . you can never go wrong with this watch(especially if you learn to use its compass!) . a perfect gift for yourself or someone special.",,,,
DIAL is VERY SMALL ..if u want a big dial watch or jst normal thn this watch is not the right one.BUT it has ALL its Function Working gud...,,,,
"I had been looking for a budget digital watch for wearing while swimming. While its use since the past month, I haven't found it taking a single beating. The water resistant feature works as advertised but I'm not sure it would work if you deliberately try to soak it for long periods. During all practical scenarios like going for a swim and taking it to shower, it worked well.
Adding to that, the watch is pretty decent looking, with the classy and resistant brown strap, you could actually wea...",,,,
"I've been using this past 2 years (purchased from LyfStyl) and its amazingly tough machine. Indigo Night-light bright as never seen before.
Strap is good but don't expect life long.
Best feature: ""Ideal For Unisex"", ""Compass Directional Ring"" & Good Water Resistance.
Buy it without doubt. :)",,,,
"I am using this watch since 2008 . I have used several types of watches including Rs. 50/- to 5000/- . My analysis is that this is one of the best watch available in market comparing to not only rate but features ,style, look ,battrey life both analog and digital and many more . The only demerit is strap which get spoiled by water when you are washing hands and changing strap is costly affair .Strap cost almost Rs.550/-. TIMEX should reduced the cost .",,,,
"Flipkart service was good.....But product quality is not good..... made of cheap plastic.... radium dial is good.... still struggling to understand the alarm and dual watch setting...
i got this one in around 2300.....next day the price was 1576...... biggest disappointment.",,,,
"Bought this watch 8 years ago and I'm still using it. Has not given up on me, ever. I've done the following repair work at Timex Store:
1. Battery change - twice in the entire course of time
2. Got the buttons replaced as they were accumulating greenish-coating on them. In addition, they cleaned the rest of the watch and removed scratches on the dial....
I use this watch extensively when I travel - I've used it in pouring rain, the watch has fallen down several times, on the floor - this is ...",,,,
"very bad watch water went inside on a normal rainy day very upset after buying please don""t buy this product",,,,
"I bought this watch some 4 months ago at a very good price. It was delivered quickly. It has many features and feels very light. The display function at the bottom serves multiple purpose. And the indiglo, though it is not very bright, good enough to see it in Night.
The watch was working superbly until I plunged that into water. I ventured into sea to a depth of nearly 10 feet (they say it can hold upto 50m). But after some days, the indiglo stopped working. Then the bottom display. Then t...",,,,
this is the best watch i hav never seen....with lots of features.it looks very similar to high end watches..but its cheap to buy .so guys I am sure its worth buying this watch without any hesitation..............................................................................................................................................................................................,,,,
"This casual watch is truly value for money. I've had mine for more than 5 years now and I've had only a couple of problems. Even though I have other watches which are costlier, I have almost always (more than 99% of the time) worn this watch.
Some problems faced:
1) The button for the Indiglo light had to be replaced as it got bent since I frequently pressed it
2) The strap, which has a really premium feel, gets worn away in 2 years or so. Replacing it is about 1/5th the price of the watch,...",,,,
"Although this watch has some pretty cool features that does not come in an 2k-3k watch But the dial size is really small. This watch is not suitable for those who has broad wrist or large hands .
When I received this watch and opened the box my first reaction was ""ITTU SI WATCH"" LOL. Only buy this want if you have small hands and also you want all these features like
-Indiglo Night-light
-Compass Directional Ring
-Chronograph Function
- Analog - Digital etc..",,,,
IIts just two months since I bought this so call ed watch and Im titally dissatisfied with the build quality of the watch firstly the dial was very small. (Dont believe the image sshow n and the two rs coin) its really very small. The strap is of poor quality cand it loses colour as fast as team India lose overseas lt has already changed to black from the sides........ Moreover the direction ring has lost all its paint and colours thus makingvit useless. The buttons are very weak tooooooo....,,,,
"It looks like a street watch(looks very cheap)
It is not even remotely close to the picture shown. Save ur money and buy something else.",,,,
"Plasticky dial look toyish.
May be good only with jean and t shirt
If you want your watch to look rich, this is not for you.",,,,
"I've got this as gift... Cost price Rs.1709...
Pros:
◆ Alarm (Really good enough sound)
◆ Indiglo light
◆ Size (Slim & compact)
◆ Good quality leather strap (fits comfortably in wrist)
◆ We shall set two digital times (Time 1 & Time 2)
Cons:
● Matches better to boys while compare to men
● Dial size should've been little bigger",,,,
"Great watch for the price. Features and specifications are top notch.
Pros:
- Good looking watch
- Good specs and features
- Water resistant
- Analogue + Digital features in one watch
- Got features like hourly chime, alarm, count down timer, indiglo lighting etc
Cons:
- Smaller than expected dial
- Plasticky feel of the watch
- Compass is just a gimmick",,,,
Not so worthy. Dont trust the image shown. The dial is quite dull. Doesnt look like a 18k watch,,,,
Very good watch,,,,

the features and options are good.light weight.BUT THE SIZE OF THE WATCH IS SMALL.DIAL IS SMALL WHICH DOESN'T SUIT ITS LOOK.,,,,
"I bought this watch a few days ago from flipkart. The features are amazing and the watch looks great on my wrist. I liked the size of this with respect to my wrist size and the color is wow. The watch is unique, great color combination, nice finishing and above all i got it at a discounted price of 2445 at flipkart. Thanks to flipkart for the service.",,,,
I purchased this watch 4 years ago its a keeper it will never betray you its just perfect it shows time very neatly it has both analogue and digital machines this is the best watch in the world.if there were any complains it would be that the strap needs changing every year and the bezel needs changing every 2 years.not that its feeble but i wear it all the time 24/7.but dont worry its a FABULOUS WATCH.,,,,
"My advice to everyone is ..dont waste your time in ordering this watch. I ordered one and it was defected. I applied for return..got another with exactly the same issue as was with the first one.
DEFECT: whenever you will turn on the green fluorescent light ..you can clearly see a black spot on the dial near the edge.
Check picture no. 4...you can see the defect here itself.",,,,
"watch doesnt look as fancy as it is on the pic ,
quite small to be honest , doesnt really suit people with normal/big hands .
better avoid this one , nothing special in this , that explains the huge discount and stuff..
better to avoid ,, however may suit girls ,or women with smaller hands n wrists , definitely not for men, out dated. however good sturdy one .",,,,
"dont buy this watch or else u will regret, i went by the looks and now i am regretting, this watch is not like it looks , it was a small dial and the color of dial is cream not white , looks like a ladies watch , boys should not buy it",,,,
Size matters looks like children watch,,,,
There is nothing same what shown in the image. the quality is too poor to wear. People will call you stupid if you will wear this watch.,,,,
"love this Timex Expedition series..
looks good in my wrist..",,,,
Awesome,,,,
Go for it.,,,,
Nice watch,,,,
very good watch.but the size is a little small,,,,
Dial size very small,,,,
Good Watch,,,,
Handsome and Strong product,,,,
A very good and classy watch under 2k.The rugged look is very cool and the small dial is no problem.Loved the product!,,,,
"Very cheap quality, not the level of expectations, dial is too small like female watch.",,,,
"Nice watch.
Supreb
You should keep far away from water if you want long life of watch leather ptta.
Watch is awesome.
I am using this watch last 4 years.now I have ordered another watch for my father.i had got only 1700 hundred.
Thanks filpcart for fast delivery.",,,,
"it's dial is too small..this watch is perfect for ladies not for men,and strap width is also very less and its material is not as dicrcibed in the specifications.",,,,
Worest watch,,,,
"It is worth buying this watch under such a wonderful price ,,,, their is no problem until now ,,,,,,,,",,,,
Nice but iam received small size,,,,
"It is very nice, awesome gift by my wife.",,,,
Nice watch.it pefect for 150mm wrist persons because it's smaller size. Iam gave 4 stars 1star not gave because outer ring colour is looking dull.,,,,
The product is good..but the size of display is small...,,,,
"The watch is not that big. So if you have huge wrists like mine, it won't be the possible look but it's size is really convenient. The best part about the sides is that it doesn't keep bashing into walls or cupboards( I am a pretty clumsy fellow).
The lighting is solid and the bands are really comfortable and sturdy.
I definitely recommend this watch.",,,,
It was not worn a single day but when I was adjusting the time the mode button cams out with a spring I have to go to the timex service centre.Except that it's a good watch.,,,,
Don't buy this item because digital disply problem and don't buy- retailnet - products,,,,
Awesome watch...!!!,,,,
Good one. Happy with your product.,,,,
"I expected a bigger dial than the actual and the directional compass ring is not good. Apart from that the product is good, light weight and have good number of options.",,,,
Good product. I love it.,,,,
Size of the watch is very small .. and watch is of cheap quality ....,,,,
Smaller​ in size... Not as expected,,,,
"Nice One ,dial is smaller but its ok Good One best Flipkart service thank u",,,,
"Again I got the damaged product. But compromised since I was it's Fan. Quality wise not impressive. Go for it only if you're the fan of ""Expedition""",,,,
Good watch,,,,
"a little smaller than expectation but okay... feels like made up of plastic. It would be great if the bezels were made up of metal.
overall good product.",,,,
"Looks good for thin hands.
Beyond the expectations.
Simply superb",,,,
Worst worst worst company showroom didnt accepted my watch when i gone to repair in warrnty they said they dont accept online purchase prodouct !,,,,
G9bdhniih(¥₩,,,,
Awesome product,,,,
The dial of this watch is too small. This watch is not suitable for men it only suitable for kids. I am satisfied about your delivery but the watch doesn't satisfying me.,,,,
"Nice watch , with various features..
Only dial of watch is quite small than expected.",,,,
Supeb watch no problems i have perched in 2013 still working in last six month change in belt only battery condition good totally ★★★★★★★,,,,
"Product delivered in totally damage packing and watch box, most horrible part was watch courier by seller in flipkart polypack with no supportive material.",,,,
The worst product i have ever see.Dial size is very small and not at all suggestable for other to buy.,,,,
"One of the flop model of Timex... I am disappointed with its look.
I tot it would look matcho, but its dial is small and doesn't bring that look.",,,,
"Indeed the watch is good without doubt. It worth money & that was the reason I bought it.
But As seen in picture I really got upset after seeing the real size. It is really small.
I hoped for big one, that was only one things really disappointed me.",,,,
"Awesome watch. I was thinking of buying a watch for a long time & was really confused about going for some high end watches as I do not really need them. But, thankfully I found this!! :-D
Special thanks to Flipkart for amazing service!!",,,,
"I was gifted this watch and using it since 2008.
One among the best analog-digital watches available in market for this price tag.
Pros:
Indiglo backlit,
Analog-digital,
Dual time zone,
Stylish,
Stop watch.
Cons:
Strap is good but don't expect life.(1 year max for daily usage)
Also the strap cost INR.500 (Not worthy)
other wise,
This product is strongly recommended.",,,,
"I got this yesterday , within 2 days of ordering . Delivery service was great . As for the watch , its packed with a lot of features . Its for people who want to have features like timer , alarm , chronograph etc in their watch . Its light, almost no weight , looks great with both formal or casual dresses . I am fully satisfied with the product . Its definitely value for money . Just one complain though , the dial color is shown white on the webpage , but i received a brown one . No big deal ...",,,,
"Timex expedition MF-13
i rated 1 star and this title because to make everyone see this review
please do not go for any other watch this one is best of all time. timex is timex, very light weight, almost 4-5 years battery, water resistance almst i have been using it for 4 and half year no problem just as new (i just brought new leather strap for it). very nice alarm tone. my friends brought casio youth series and other one fastrack. but now both fastrack and casio are not in good condition...",,,,
"This Timex Expedition watch is for those who want a sporty analog watch. The digital part of the watch gives all the little perks like chronograph, the countdown timer, dual time alarm etc while still giving the solid look of an analog watch. The compass isn't that useful as one would imagine as it requires you to find the sun and set the compass to directions. The strap looks good and feels light(leather one), only it darkens after a few months.
Pros:
1. Almost all the features that you wou...",,,,
"I have been wearing this watch for over three years and it's fantastic. I have a comparatively slimmer wrist and that's why I love the size of this watch. The 38 mm dial is just perfect for me. The watch has everything you need. Digital time, analog time, date, month, alarm, stopwatch and more. And the Indiglo feature always manages to take you back to the 90s when these things were too cool to be flaunted. Since I have a deep love for vintage and classic stuff, it still excites me when I pus...",,,,
I puchased this watch in nov. Now that is not work. And the belt quality is low. Within a week belt look like a dirty...,,,,
"the dial is too small.. plus the colour of dial is creamish.. which does not look good at all...
It is not as attractive as shown in image....",,,,
This belt qulity is not good at all.My belt became black and brownish colour within 1 month.It is so sensitive that if we drop down it will be broken.For me me belt hanger is gone.But I like the design.,,,,
Good watch,,,,
Belt is not durable..,,,,
A Great watch.Having used this watch for close to 10 years makes it truly memorable.Had changed the strap three times and the battery 5 times otherwise excellent.The current price is a steal as I paid close to Rs 3700/ that time.,,,,
Dnt buy if u r seeing for metallic dial this one is having plastic dial...,,,,
its very comfy nd especially if u have small wrist its suits better than ny other watch .. looks great on formals nd suits well on casuals .. happy to buy this .. abt tht black mark on the dial .. it hardly has ny significance coz only a small portion rather very portion get blackened while using indiglo(light) feature.. worth the price .. happy for dual time modes .!!,,,,
"I received my package after 4 days of placing the order, i got it for 1573/- . Packed in a petite square box, with user manual and a list of service centres across India. I laid my eyes upon the watch, beige colored bezel and its little digital display.
For guys, as this looks large in pictures infact it is not, it sits nicely upon the wrist but it is a bit smaller than a normal watch.
For girls, if you want to try something other than your girly watches, this is the perfect piece for you.
...",,,,
"Writing the review after owning this timepiece for 6 months, so far have been fully satisfied by my choice also for the price I got it ?1800/- it was the best purchase ever. My requirements were basic a date function, white dial(although this isn't; the light shade looks good) and leather belt(formal look) with price around ?2000/- and so I zeroed on this watch after doing good research.
Also the watch has way too many functions which even watches in higher price bracket lack the looks of wa...",,,,
"The actual watch looks different to the picture shown. The dial is certainly not as bright (a dull brown) and even the case is much more dull in color compared to the picture. This does not mean it is necessarily unattractive, but is quite different to the picture. Much more dull with a more rugged look.",,,,
"Watch is good, though it looks little small for guys with large built. Absolute value for money. Its dial is not white as shown in the image its dirty white or brownish. Got it for just Rs 2274 under sale on flipkart.",,,,
"This one feature loaded watch at this rate, i have been using it for the last 1 and half year. its light , rugged, just got all features u need, sm you may not use day to day. good and clean backlight to see in night.
the con is the mode system to use all features, sometimes u have to refer manual for doing so...you can't remember. But it is subjective.
overall its a best watch, who want simplicity and performance.
this is one u got to choose.",,,,
"Fantastic piece
I just love it
Fab look with a lot of features
With two time zone it is like a pilot watch buy it now!!!!!!",,,,
