"Pros:
Amazing Looks...Stylish....Big Dial...one of my best online purchase ever...Hope this watch from Fossil last long...
Cons:
Fossil doesn't have any service centre in Kolkata.",,,,
Don't buy this.. Money waste.. I got defect product after replacement.. Strap quality issue and also dial colour issue. It looks like first copy..,,,,
This product received defective even after return,,,,
"Watch looks premium, however the dial is really big,wish this had better product description on Flipkart. Flipkart delivery was as expected, product packaging was great. I will update the review after a month or two.",,,,
"The product looked good so rating it to max, but still i had to return it. The reason being, the dial was too big. The description image shows the diameter to be 41mm, but it must be close around 47-50 mm. Apart from that the watch is as shown in images. Just be careful if you want that big a dial or not.",,,,
Awesome product.. big blue dial.. Great look.. Genuine leather strap.. branded watch at a cost of 5k.. Quality comes at a cst.. Both with formal and casual can be weared.. Grt packaging.. Fossil name itself enough to build your status..,,,,
"I got a defective watch on 1st order. The second hand of chronograph was not at zero position at reset. Fossil logo seal was not present on plastic case of the watch. After i raised request for replacement, i got the watch that was sealed with fossil logo. So guys do check the packaging.
Coming to watch. The design is superb. Dial is big and clear. Chronograph works smoothly. Best watch in this price range.",,,,
Good Product,,,,
Can give five star but have a small about is it original or copy,,,,
Good,,,,
"It looks great, but the dial size is quite big, so if you have a thin wrist it wont be suitable.",,,,

"Good and premium look.
Warranty card not signed and stampted by dealer. Flipkart says it normal procedure and warranty is valid with invoice.",,,,

The watch is good. But I have to return because dial was bigger than my wrist. Do check Fossil's website and check the dial size. It's really Huge...,,,,

"It's a very good watch. Strap & dial color combination provides a classy look. Chronographs work fantastic.
Cons are, dial is very big. Dial isn't polished well, that's why it doesn't provide the solid & shiny look.
Packaging by the courier service need to be improved. There is no bubbles wraps or any other anti-damage walling inside the package. 3.5 stars is my rating.",,,,
Good,,,,
Expected one,,,,
"Dial of this watch is bigger than expected.
Otherwise sharp character inside the dial.",,,,
Very nice product,,,,
"The watch is beautiful ,although a bit bulky, but the delivery was pathetic. The carton box was almost torn and watch box was severely dented. It looked like something really heavy was put over the box. Very disappointing delivery experience.",,,,
Good make,,,,
"Fantastic.
Worth buying.",,,,
Good product!!,,,,
Its not look like original,,,,
Good,,,,
Very nice product,,,,
Awesome product,,,,
Classy watch lv this,,,,
Amazing watch... Thanks flipkart for quick delivery... Appreciated!,,,,
Awesome product by fossil...loving it,,,,
"Great watch, Great packing, its look more better then what it looks in pic. The only thing is i haven't got any signature or dates on warranty card. As it's necessary to claim warranty.",,,,
Watch looks superb. Strap is so soft.Blue & brown combination is most attractive. But non of the small dials are for date. One for 24hr clock format other 2 for stopwatch.,,,,
I am Rajan and I gifted this to my brother and I am getting lots of appreciation because this Fossil watch is an one of the best model in cheapest price and affordable and as per my knowledge no one provide this kind of good product in cheapest price. I am very happy to bought this watch and hereafter I will prefer only Fossil watches. Thank you Flipkart for the best product.,,,,
