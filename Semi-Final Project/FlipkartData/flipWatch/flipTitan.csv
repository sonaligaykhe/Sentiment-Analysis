"Good Quality. it's stylish, I bought it for my dad",,,,
"bought this watch for my husband couple of months ago... he loved it instantly.Design wise it has that timeless classic feel with the leather strap and the metal body. when the world is obsessed with chronographs ...this analog adds a bit of old school retro class to your collection.no issues yet... came in a bad box though.
The knob at the side is big enough to set the time and not the ultra teeny ones we find nowadays. it's suitable for daily wear.love the product",,,,
Very nice ND I gift my father lnlaw... He very happy for my gift,,,,
"I got this for 2700. if you want to gift someone it would be a great choice but i bought it for myself. Overall i am happy with it. I bought this watch 1 year ago and there is no problem till now except that strap leather is getting peeled off in patches so strap needs to be changed after one year. Rest all is good. No complaints.
Pros- great looks, titan tag, good for casual wear,
Cons- strap needs to be changed after 1 yr",,,,
"Bought the watch from flipkart. Got delivery in 2 days flat & was neatly packed.
The watch is simply great...got many compliments for it. It can be worn on a formal attire but goes best with smart casuals or casuals. Good quality and attractive dial is what makes it stand out. Its a tad bit big than the regular watch but also on medium wrists like mine...it does go well.
4 stars and a recommended buy.!!!",,,,

I ordered replacement because the color if watch was yellowish and the watch I got after replacement is again the same .. it showed a different and good watch but the one which I received twice is worst ..,,,,
Happy,,,,
I didn't received the same ... In the dail its wirtten octane with looks copy . So Titan plz keep it as it is . Do not add words in the dail... Only brand name looks superb. Otherwise watch is excellent..,,,,
"The clock is very good to see, the metal quality is also very good but after one week of taking the clock it off itself. Sometimes the time lags itself automatically. I thought I had bought a fake watch. I do not trust flipkart.",,,,
Worst watch,,,,
Nice watch,,,,
Very good product,,,,
"The product is not as shown in picture. Plz go to titans official website, verify and only then purchase. Don't make the mistake I made.",,,,
Excellent watch. It has a nice big dial .It also shows the date. The watch looks elegant & beautiful. It also shows neon lights in dark,,,,
"I am writing this review after using it for 1 Year.
First of all it's different from the pictures you are seeing online. Its little bit ligher than shown.
Secondly its strip quality. its average. After few months its gona lose its charm. Its polish surface will be lost doesn't matter how well you keep the watch.
Apart from this its a good watch.",,,,
