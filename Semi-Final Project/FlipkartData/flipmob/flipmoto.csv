Pros - Very good camera, Android 7 works like a charm, 4G and GPS are swift to use.

Got another piece.
The lock button of the new piece is pressed in. It is almost levelled with the phone body.
Motorola is a disappointment. It was good once upon a time.
Manufacturing defects in 2 products which I bought and replaced. So, for me, it is 100% probable that every phone has a manufacturing defect.
Flipkart provides only one time replacement. And I have got defective pieces both the times.

"The hype created about this phone is utter disappointment. There are two major issues with the phone and the very important ones:
1) BATTERY ISSUE
It just drains so quickly, even when the phone is locked, it seems to drain very fast. I had J-7, which had similar 3000 mAh battery, compared to it I feel the real capacity of G5 plus battery is around 2000-2200 mAh. Also it takes 2 hours to charge phone from 15% to 100%, I donno how it is fast charging.
BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT. What's the use of...",,,,

"I am writing this review after 10 days of hardcore use. This phone works like a beast. If you want a budget phone whichgives performance as well a good camera then just go for it without looking on bad reviews. Any phone is not perfect. As we all know that every phone has some cons.

- nothing else is grate
2)corns

"Phone looks very good. Got it delivered in less than 2 days. Camera is good
Battery capacity is real good.
No lag while playing heavy games too.
Fingerprint best of it's kind I should say.
Only con is "" It doesn't support 4g on both the sim cards at same time "".
""Premium budget mobile"" is the better word to describe this phone",,,,
"The phone is really good for the price range.
The only slight issues I could find were
1. The speaker if really soft
Otherwise it is amazing at battery life specially the turbo charge nails it. It does heat up very Little while charging , but no issues in performance.
The camera is good with features like dslr control and 4k recording, the screen res is also good , it could have been a lil more bright like Motog4plus .
The high end games work without any lag,
Finger sensor is very quick in ...",,,,

"I was wondering I would've given 5 stars ✨ if you could've send me the phone which is in working condition. But your sent non working phone! That too basic functionality of vibration is not working... Frankly shame on you rite???
Apart from vibration it's good features and specs. You can easily buy this without doubt but like this happens because of stupid sellers. They think buyers as fools...
Flipkart you could've verified before delivery of the products rite? Why don't you do that?

Received defective product as lines in display like a ruled book even when the mobile is on or off. Highly disappointed.,,,,

1) Reduce screen brightness (I wonder they could have disabled brightness adjustment slider)
2) Don't keep applications running in background (What is use of 4GB Ram ? )
3) Minimize battery consumption ( I will have to be very cautious while using phone)
4) Reboot it whenever possible (After reboot magic will happen)

2) With the one-button navigation, I'm getting quite ...",,,,
"I've been using the G5 plus 4gb for 2 weeks now. Exchanged it with my one plus one for 6k plus a discount with my SBI card. So, all in all a good deal. The phone is great for the price. Stock android. Smooth experience. Minimal lag. The Camera is great. Battery lasts for a day, with 3g data turned on most of the time. Turbo charge is ok, not as fast as expected.

Microphone noise issue is very annoying. Recorded videos are mostly unusable due to high background noise, and during call, if outdoors, the other person cannot hear you at all.
Very problematic and moto/lenovo is not giving any bug fix for that. I mailed them and just got a generic answer - ""soon"". DO NOT BUY if this will hamper your work. Others, flood lenovo with bug fix request, they are ignoring their customers.

"After 24+ hours of usage here is my viewpoint,
Build quality is very firm and looks very premium. One will love the detailing on the back panel and the chrome garnish around the bezel looks upmarket. The overall form factor is compact and easy to use, thanks to 5.2-inch profile and extreme light-weightedness. Though there is a slight bump for housing the back camera, one needs to be extra careful while putting it on flat surfaces. The IPS LCD when not lit shows strange horizontal lines when s...",,,,

All good so far with No heating and super new OS. No lagging with games like Super Mario & FIFA. But disappointed with 2 major things: A)No speakers basically..I mean it's a basic one inscr ibed inside headphone speaker resulting in Extremely Low Sound.
B)Not at all a Turbo Charger. It takes 2hr and 10-15mts apprx to fully charge. I charged with my old LG G3 charger as well and bouy it's the same timings!!!
If u are fine with above two issues, grab the phone!!",,,,

"Kudos to Flipkart and team for delivering the product within 36hours. Now about the phone- the phone is very light, design is also good. Best thing is the Camera.. Lowlight images are clear, the Dual Autofocus Pixels lets you lock focus in a blink. The front camera has great colour accuracy with adequate light, lowlight images were so-so.
Played heavy games like wwe immortals, mortal combat 5 without any lag thanks to the 4gb RAM.
Sound is not so good.
Turbo Charging functionality was must a...",,,,
"NO NATIVE (direct from phone with 3rd party app) VIDEO CALL OPTION AVAILABLE IN THIS PHONE AS LIKE IN SAMSUNG, MI AND OTHER BRANDS. MOTOROLA SHOULD PROVIDE THIS FUNCTION TO THEIR USERS OTHERWISE phone is good. camera in low light is very good. All over phone is good in this price range.",,,,
Arguably the best all round smartphone under 20K.,,,,
Mobile looking super,,,,
Performance wise no problem but I found heating issue,,,,
"I have purchased moto g5 plus 26 days back,from the very first day i am facing problems with this phone.Touch screen is not working properly,when i complained regarding the problem with flipcart they refused to take it back.Flipcart is cheating many people because they are not fulfilling return policy.I will never ever purchase anything from flipcart in future ,will not allow anybody from my circle to purchase anything from these cheaters.",,,,

It has best in class camera, best performance, awesome battery life thanks to Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 ,Good display, and amazing Stock Android 7.0, and 4k video !!!, Moto display, Moto Actions are also awesome",,,,
"Good product value for money, looks great in hand, buttery smooth, one thing I observed phone automatically lost wifi network and it is very frequent mai be OTA update will help, camera is average overall phone is good.",,,,
"Everything OK in phone without speakers and microphone which have many issues regarding sound quality and many deflections also no any satisfaction from flipcart, totally nastier service.... And reject replacement and turn face on the issue. ABSURD",,,,
"Well I need not discuss about the processor speed and other specifications of the phone, as they have been already discussed in other reviews. I ordered for grey variant and though it looks bit masculine in nature but I like it. This has been lucky for me. Now I feel confident. Earlier people used to ignore me but since I had ordered this phone behaviour of people has changed towards me. Now my seniors entrust me with confidential work unlike before. I already had grey coloured Activa and hel...",,,,
"Flipkart wants me to believe that delivery means delivery and no matter if the product was defective or damaged. Replacements will happen though different process, will have to wait till the defective product is picked .
I have been running pillar to post to understand why -
1) replacement cannot happen though express delivery when you have already charged at the time of ordered, why should customers pay for delivery charges for damaged product
2)Call centre team suggest they have no clue...",,,,
"Bought this phone on same day when they launched. Now I guess its 7th day. TURBO means super fast charging but its taking 2 hours to charge the phone.
Is this meaning of TURBO Charging?",,,,
"I ordered moto G5 plus on 15th march and Flipkart is very fast in delivering. I got my phone on 18th march.
According to me this is best mid range phone from moto. Here is my review after 4 days.
Pros:-
1) awesome camera(both back and front)
2) battery backup is really very good
3) screen resolution and screen quality is also very good
4) obviously it has turbo charger so it charges very fast(take 1-1:30 hours to charge)
5) it doesn't heat while charging
6) very good design as this phone has ...",,,,
"Tis' a Nice Phone, priced so Fair,
Display so crisp, I see no Glare,
The camera did amaze me,
Aperture of f/1.7 too,
Can shoot in quite dark,
Tis' sure to amaze you.
Fingerprint scanner, did justice to the phone,
Tis' so accurate, got my mind blown.
Snapdragon 625, performs like a beast,
Using it for hours, I still feel no heat.
Battery packs small, still lasts long time,
Turbo Charger is Bae, performs very Fine.
Looks very sleek, Tis' a beautiful device,
Also performs great, got some great ...",,,,
"Those Who read the negative reviews and afraid about buying it through flipkart ... Please go for it! Its absolutely perfect ! Got it the very next day i ordered and its perfect !
Here r the reasons why g5+ is a better option than redmi note 4!
Camera is better in G5 + ! MegaPixels dont matter but the lens matter! And redmi sucks on camera but g5+ works perfectly in low light too and also front cam is so so good in details and perfect!
Battery is pretty good on both but g5+ has quick cha...",,,,
"I was looking for a change after using Apple iphone 5S from 2 years !! And i brought the perfect one Hello Moto.
This is company's most premium Moto G phone yet. It is also the most ambitious. It comes with a metal body. It also has a few special components like that much-talked about camera
Moto G5 Plus Fine Gold
Moto G5 Plus Plastic out, aluminium in. :)
Moto G5 Plus a smaller 5.2-inch screen easier to carry and easier to use. :)
Moto G5 Plus has a design that seems more Awsomeeeeeee. ...",,,,

The golden colour model look very cheap
The phn start hanging from the first day.
When used with jio the phone comes in a loop and come to contact list .
Sound is not good as expected
Camera quality is very poor .. original colour goes missing from the photo.
Will not suggest to buy..",,,,

"Mobile is marvelous.....battery is good
No lag.....camera is awesome..I think Dolby atoms should be added by lenovo
...but price is too high and moto made g5splus which disappointed me at this g5 price after 2 months of purchasing",,,,
Everything seems good except for heating issue. got this two days back and it gets insanely heated when charging,,,,
Low light camera is poor Quality,,,,
"Flipkart took 5 days to deliver product to my door way. I think to long but got my phone ,when I was sitting the phone it could not detect my own WiFi but can detect my neighbor WiFi....So, I call customer care they didn't response me .With the help of YouTube I was trying to find out what happening with my phone got no answers I change my mind to return the product so I reset my phone to data factory luckily!! I see my wifi Network then it connects with my WiFi.. I didn't used that much till...",,,,
"1.A lot of hanging and lagging issue on apps and games
2.A lot of heating issue
3.volume dead on apps and games
4.sim card tray doesn't work
5.auto power off and on issue
I got the worst online shopping experience from flipkart.. It's very easy to give a statement of easy return but it never goes same....providing defected phone then wasting your time by formalities and in the end.. you get nothing but a defected phone .... #nomoreflipkart
Well at last in place of replacing my item they

"Update 3:
It's a good phone but fails miserably in the most important area: ability to make calls!
It just can't latch on to the signal in areas where signal reception is not great. It frequently looses connectivity in such areas. If if Network comes up, the voice breaks or calls drop. The rest of the phones in the house on the same Airtel Network work perfectly fine in the same areas.
Also, the phone has problems finding and connecting to the best band - 2g, 3g or 4g. So signal drops fro...",,,,
"Camera not performed as Expected and as described on websites.
Color production is not good. Even G4 plus and X-Play worked better than this.
Camera worked awesome in Night ONLY. Breezes are so much space taking for a 5.2 inch screen phone.
My X-Play has the smaller dimensions although having 5.5inch screen.
Speaker getting activated after 2-4 second during a call.
Google Maps not able to provide correct direction as COMPASS is NOT there in phone.
Phone getting heated upto 40 degree Celsiu...",,,,

Pros.
1. Software - If you are looking for a clean android experience Buy moto g5 plus. No Bloatware at all. and you can even disable all google apps including google search. Moto Experiences are a great Addition --Must have.
2. Call - GPS -Network - all seem fine.
