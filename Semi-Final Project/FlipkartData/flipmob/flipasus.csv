No battery 5000 mah,,,,
The phone is nice but volte is not working as claimed by asus....service provider says its a Lte phone as shown by their system...can't understand whom to believe..,,,,

Much better than Lenovo Moto
Still Missing Google Moto lenovo killed the brand",,,,
Excellent product.. i bought in 8999/- .I am fully satisfied with my new Asus zenfone 3x max.. battery backup is very good and phone looks like a premium phone.. camera is not up to the mark but in 9000 I am satisfy with all features ..I bought 2 phones from flipkart but didn't receive otg cable in one box.. one black colour phone delivered within 24 hours after order and another gold one took 5 days to deliver.. because I don't play games on phone so didn't face any heating issue yet.. call ...,,,,
Fingerprinting is not that sensitive,,,,
"Awesome.....camera ,baterry,touch ,and the delivery time....thankz to flitkart...",,,,
Wow beautiful...!!!,,,,
"I got the phone at just 8999.delivery was good.thanks to flipkart.now about my reviews about the device.
1. the sound with dolby atmos is quite amazing.headphones given inside the box are of high quality.2 sets of extra earplugs are too provided in the box.
2.otg is supported well.the good thing is asus otg cable is given free inside box.
3.fully metal body .amaxing smoothy texture both and back and front and with 2.5d curved led glass the phone looks premium.
4.a bit heating problem but can ...",,,,
Perfect,,,,
Nice one,,,,
"I bought this only for long battery back up.But after using 3 month I can say that it has good bttery life and also it has no heating issue..camera quality is not so good.
.smart fimgerprint lock.. split screen fecility..latest android..3gb ram and the smoothness of the touch screen forced me to give 5 star...there is also no laging problem and heating issue..But if you want a phone with great camers quality,it is not for you.",,,,
Never buy this phone. No Gorilla glass display and really very poor quality display and touch. In New phone also after 2 days hang problem and not able to clear few notifications and mobile suddenly restart realy worst thing I ever seen in brand new phone.,,,,
"Very bad mobile in 1st time used
Don't purchased this mobile..my personal advice",,,,
My phone got switched off due to software issue within 15 days of receipt of the handset. This is absolutely not expected and acceptable.I am highly disappointed.,,,,
"1. Heating problem
2. Both camera not good its like 2 MP front 5 back like
3. Ram 3 GB but this phone and mobile app already covered up to 2 GB
4. Rate two high
5. I have been received damaged phone display little bit damaged",,,,
"Worst product in ASUS
1. Hanging problem
2. After updating software network tower display goes off, unable to turn on/off the mobile data
3. After some time it is not getting turn on-hanged in intel display stage itself
4. It getting heat like anything
5. Camera capture button not working sometimes-hanged.",,,,
"Initially I have given a good rating and strongly recommended product on the date of receipt of this phone for the appearance and built quality, also this is a budgeted phone comes with OS Android 7 out of box.
But later after using this phone for 4-5 days I am experiencing terrific hanging issue.
Asus team pls review your product otherwise it will definitely hamper your brand image.",,,,
"very bad this product,",,,,
"Premium look, hold feel and interface
takes time to adapt to ASUS and bad camera.
I had taken it as my 2nd phone but it can be your only phone also.",,,,
"The mobile is just awesome... It has more fearures than i expected...
Charger is very good... Getting charge very fast...
I loved the headset... Really wonderfull...
Am using ASUS ZENFONE MAX for the past 1 and half years.. My fone dsn't get heat even wen i use it all the day... So i bought this one for my mother... The great drawback is its getting heat... If it was not there i might gave 5 stars... But i love all the other features...",,,,

"One of the best phone by ASUS .I am in love with phone.User interface is awesome.Battery back up is excellent .Camera quality is very good.Look wise the phone is awesome.
This phone is not a gaming phone so while playing game the phone heats little bit.But if you don't play games on mobile and use it mainly for browsing,calling,cheating,listening music,browsing YouTube and love to take photo and selfie then you must buy this phone.",,,,
"Pros:
1) Good Battery life
2) Works with VoLTE
3) Reverse Charging
4) In-built ASUS apps very useful
5) Ear phones with good quality which you don't get normally from other brands
Cons:
1) The only drawback i found is touch is not that great (as compare to iphone)",,,,
