"First to Flipkart delivery service - Thanks a lot, I received it earlier than promised. I also received a chocolate from you guys, it felt really nice. Multiplied my joys of receiving my new phone.
Now to the iPhone.
Packaging - As always - neat & superior!
The phone - It feels great. I personally chose the iPhone 7 over 7+ because of the size. Moving from iPhone 5 to 7 was absolutely no downer in terms of size, the size suited me well. Specifications wise - still exploring. ;)

Voice reception is very feeble. Product packaging does not seem to be original. Seems like meddled and repacked using small small cello tapes at corners and stickers.,,,,

"Writing the review upgrading from an iPhone 6.
The increased speed and camera are great! 3D Touch feels a little incomplete but is convenient nonetheless. While the design is the same as the 6, the black really makes it stand out. Stunning finish on the matte black.

Dont worry go for it 100% original,,,,
Simply outstanding & no compare,,,,

"On Time Delivery Best Part Of Flipkart.
Amazing Deal as always with Flipkart.
Coming to iPhone 7. Really nice feel.
Apple has the best product they know what people want. All the features in one hand. Really a fan of apple.
Flipkart delivered what they promised.",,,,
I buy new iPhone 7 from flipkart. It is really awesome. Thanks,,,,
"What you expect
Its iphone;)",,,,
"Pros:
Sleek and handy, no more chunks of heavy metal
Premium and stylish, Matt black looks royal.
Camera is stunning, you can't believe, it nurtured a hidden photographer in me to such an extent that I bought a dslr now, most of my pics are clicked on it. Camera is comparable to point and shoot standalones.
Battery life is more than sufficient.
iOS is more secure and reliable.
Sound is louder and crisper then 6 th generation
Aluminium 7000 series is more sturdy
Cons:
No 3.5 mm, but ...",,,,
"I got the product on 25th sept. Since then I have been waiting for the order invoice but have not received it even after following up with flipkart customer service executives multiple times. I am so disappointed with their responses. It makes me feel as if I am dealing with some sarkari office which doesnt want to work.
For this bad experience i would never shop again with flipkart.",,,,
"You Fraud Flipkart
The Iphone displaying in ur app as delivered was never delivered to me. Although it was COD but still you did not fulfill your promise of delivering the phone on Sale Price of 39,999/-
Flipkart is Fraud. Will never order anything from flipkart anymore.",,,,
I received my product before one day delivery date.I fear due to some negative review against seller supercomnet. I don't understand why people are comment negative review.But I had recieved original product.I have checked serial number and imie no in apple site and it shows original.I am first user of apple.Really it is amazing to use i phone 7.Before I have used samsung note4.It is totally difference between ios and android.Ios is very smooth and clean software.So thanks to flipkart and sup...,,,,
"Upgraded from iPhone 6 to 6s to se to 7... Build quality has been awesome from Apple... They are surely investing a lot of their intellect in designing... No one can beat them in that section. Coming to performance, well there's only one conclusion - at the end of the day it's an Apple..The Name says it all... Camera captures natural true tone colors... Not oversaturated or washed out, almost the perfect.. Battery - has improved a bit but not spectacular as always... Definitely an improvement...",,,,
Product I received is having damage... Not able to replace it,,,,
Flipkart always gives his best when it comes to quality and delivery. Thanks for making purchases so easy and effortable. 5Star to all your services and offers you being to us. 5star to Flawless service and trust full offers,,,,
"Hi I've just got my iPhone 7 32 gb black , and one of the bottom speakers are not working . I called up the guys at service centre and this woman Shruti , who's a senior attended me and said that they can't help me anyhow , I'll have to visit the service centre . What kind of stupidity is this ? I spend more than 40,000 on a mobile phone thinking that it's flip kart and seller seems to be good and this is the type of stabbing they do to you. Now I'll have to run to the service centre for thei...",,,,
Dont buy from flipkart providing fake offers. I purchased 7 on credit card emi delivery boy came and took the product along with him poor service nd not got satisfied revert from the support team bad experience ever.,,,,

"iPhone 7 - 32GB Black
Pros :
- Superfast A10 Processor
- Improved Home button (Haptic Feedback)
- Excellent Low light camera with Image stabilisation
- 32GB Storage from base models
- Improved Stereo sound from speakers
- Great battery life. Almost lasts for a day with a full charge. Significantly better than the predecessor.
- Most importantly, this time it is waterproof.
Cons :
- I had the iPhone 6S (16GB), I haven't noticed much difference and the aesthetics of the phone just fee...",,,,
"It would be presumptuous to not acknowledge that all those who pre-ordered this device, myself included, have done it simply for the allure of the latest iPhone. Even as I say this, I wasnt entirely convinced of the iPhone 7 when I watched the livestream of the Apple Keynote. However, a timely launch in India, less exorbitant pricing and a hefty cashback was what finally swung me in favour of it.
While Apple might have not made much headway in design for 3 generations now, I take some solac...",,,,
"Yeha it is amazing phone oh I am sorry its iPhone
It was quite difficult for me because I switched from android but right now I am more comfortable with iOS
I am using almost all features of iPhone
That was not happening with android
Yes I was thinking to buy Oneplus product but my decision was right because its hardware features is only huge number
iPhone is highly optimise yeha but battery life is quite less",,,,
"#beast
This is my second iPhone. I upgraded from 5s.. My advice: If youre looking to upgrade your phone, iPhone 7 is awesome. If you have some spare money iPhone 8 is better but 7 & 8 has no much difference;so why waste another 10k on the same product.
After a week of nonstop uses:
Performance: 9.5/10. Its a #beast. Lightning fast.
Battery: 8/10. Single full charged,I can used the whole day
Camera: 10/10. Awesome.
Overall: One of the fastest and best looking phone. Go for it. After all...",,,,
Ordered iPhone 7 (Black) from SuperComNet during Republic Day sale. Received a genuine phone on the very next day. Not sure why so many negative reviews for the seller. Overall I am very happy with the seller and of course Flipkart and its courier partner ekart.,,,,
Phone repacked product does not buy,,,,
"Flipkart is worst app to shop any product. Their customer care agents are what to say. . Everything is so bad that you cannot expect any help from them. They are going to blame you only for their faults whether it is app issue, any return, any refund, any damage, any thing.. hate you guys. Your escalation team was going to call me back in 24 hours and it's more than 60hours where the hell is your escalation team.
One should never purchase any thing from flipkart. They make fool of you with t...",,,,
"Awesome phone even in 2017 great performance, camera and someone looking to buy an iPhone go for this rathar than i8 coz performance vise there is not much difference but price vise there is difference. Only iPhone X outperforms this on sheer performance and thank u flipkart and associated for delivering my product on time.",,,,
It's was an owsm experience with the sale one of the best product in market today,,,,

Amazing phone @Amazing price",,,,
Got iphone 7 at unexpected price 39999..thank you flipkart..packing was not as good as a iphone 7 should have..,,,,
Great product :),,,,
Brilliant product with super internal specs!!,,,,
"Firstly flipkart did a fair job on delivering the phone despite the huge number of orders.
Overall iPhone 7 is a nice upgrade from iPhone 6 as I got 3D touch, Live photos, better camera, Better processor, Stereo speakers and it's water proof.
But I don't think it has much to offer if you are already using iPhone 6S.",,,,
"Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery. No need to explain the product, iphone is just self explaintory.
And for those having issues or claiming the product to be defected, first of all go for fassured seller only and watch out some unboxing videos beforehand so as to get an idea of sealed box and when ever unboxing new iphone just look out for sealing i.e. Original seal is not hampered and match that IMEI no of phone and bill with that of box, you will be good to go",,,,
"At first I was very sceptical about the seller and genuineness of the product since I bought this product at extremely cheap rate during sale. However after one month of using it, the product has shown absolutely no glitches that makes me doubt that the product is counterfeit or something. Hence I would recommend others to go for this one.",,,,
"Excellent product, worth the money...",,,,
"Used an ios product for the first time, thanks to flipkat's 40k price, nice phone, heats a little more than what I expected but performance is amazing, benchmark score varies according to the temperature, kept in the fridge and benchmark scores were on par with other iPhone scores!! Overall satisfied with the purchase",,,,
"Was not expecting this, the cable inside box is not working i sent flipkart a complain but not receiving any reply yet i checked it with other devices too bt no use now using my old iphone's cable for charging",,,,
"I have never ordered anything expensive online. This was my first, and I was nervous how it will be. However I am pleased with Flipkart and the seller. The product was delivered on time and original. Thank you.",,,,
"Ordered on 22nd last month during Big Billion Day offer & received on 24th !! Too happy with the device. Confirmed positive as a genuine device from Apple India Customer Care!! Happy with the performance since I just switched from Oneplus 3T . But only issue is the battery backup after upgrading to ios 11. My advise to the newcomers, do not upgrade from ios 10 before the fix is being released by Apple !! Cheers !!",,,,
I am unable to use this with data phone is getting huge heat need to replace,,,,
Awesome phone.,,,,

Ringtone not working.There is no replacement as well,,,,
Fulfilled the wish. Nice work . Got my iPhone 7 black . Loved the facility of flipkart,,,,
"I have ordered an I phone 7 and I got it on 25th of september. It works for 3 days and now it stop working unexpectedley. Its not even turning on now. Apple support is asking me to return it but there is no return option available on site. I want to replace it or want my refund.
Apple is asking for refund from Flipkart and Flipkart is not giving any return option (Not even a single day replacement)
Will never buy anything from Flipkart and suggest you guys the same.",,,,
"So I got my first Apple I Phone 7 , thanks to Flipkart for amazing low price of 38499/- on there big billion day, package arrived before time.
Here was my New I phone 7, mesmerizing look, feature touch , crisp and clear display, sound at its best, even the ear-pods are too classy and give a good sound. When I started using Apple I phone then i realized why they cost more than any other smartphone. They have terrific after sale support. My phone was heating a bit for Initial 2 days, then i c...",,,,
Mobile is good. No defects thanks to supercomnet retailers. Flipkart delivered after a week and promised date but they would have delivered early before promised date. They miss routed couriers and I can see misrouted sticked on package.Apart from Ekart delivery product is good and I have noticed mobile heating up when high utilisation is happening mostly using WhatsApp video calling but not frequently.its been two months of experience in iphone7 mobile is good and inbuilt apps are cool.,,,,
Nice product. Camera quality is average. I should have bought iphone 8 instead. No other regrets.,,,,
"Excellent and great value for money. It's been a great experience after moving from iPhone 4s for 4 years to iPhone 7. Everything seems to be new, fast touch response and finger print sensor is great. Best and fast processor in the current smartphones. Camera is outstanding, I always had better camera experience in iPhone 4s and now iPhone 7 with 12mp & 7mp is really great, especially low light shots are great. Although missing 3.5mm jack but lightning cable for headphone and charger is also ...",,,,
"Product:
A better touch and response time then previous versions of iPhone. Black color is super cool, though not much change in looks. Camera upgrade is good, with a brighter display.
Stereo sound is good, new home button is quite sensitive, overall a good buy.
Delivery and packaging:
Timely delivery and in a uber cool box, kudos to Flipkart for that",,,,
"Superb phone, elegant, stylish and classy colour matte black...made a great choice :)
Flipkart lived up to its delivery promise which is today the launch day. Overall brilliant! Worth the money spent",,,,

I received my product at 8 PM, within one hour of the launch. With great excitement I open the packing that said priority. Upon opening I found a flipkart exclusive black box designed for iPhone 7. This packing is elegant and a surprise. Kudos to flipkart for the packing and delivery.
Coming to the phone:
1) The colour is elegant. Even though the...",,,,

Will not recommended buying an iphone from here",,,,
Very happy as this is my first iphone and satisfied with delivery service by flipkart.,,,,
It's been 6 hours since I've been using this phone. Perfect beauty....no lag camera is awesome. Every penny spent on this phone is worth it. Only problem that I am facing is with ringtone. My phone is only vibrating while an incoming call. As I am able to play song so it means speaker is fine. I will figure it out. One star deducted is for that only. Hope the problem will get resolved. Last but not the least flipkart is good as usual. Delivered next day of placing my order. Hope the phone is ...,,,,
"I got my iPhone 7 on 9th Nov. 2017 and this is my 2nd iphone in a row. I'm using 5S and now bought iphone 7.. filpkart delivery is awesome, got it within 18 hrs from the order. Nothing to say about iphone 7.. it's really sleek and black model looks hot in hand. Live picture is looks nice. Camera took pics like they are live.

I love iPhone 7. It's really awesome and Flipkart delivery also too good.....,,,,

nice genuine product,,,,
Excellent product.....,,,,
As good as 6S,,,,
Good product paisa wasul.,,,,
"My opinion is to buy this type of costly products from the Apple Store only, because the product which I received was a opened sealed box, then Flipkart replaced it and now I am having a brand new product, but this is not at all expected when you are buying such costly products, I had to be without any smartphone for 8 days, so please go for Apple Store rather than buying used products.",,,,
Excellent product with nice packaging. Delivered ahead of schedule. Was worried whether it could be refurbished. But to my surprise a new device. Feeling happy with the service from Flipkart.,,,,
Not satisfied with the product,,,,
"Got it at an all time low price of rs.37250 in diwali sale last year that too at an attractive zero cost EMI. The best iPhone so far.. Handy, water proof, great camera and killer performance.",,,,
"Awesome
Got the phone as fast as possible.
The phone is original no problem with the phone. you have not broken my trust flipkart.
Everyone waiting must buy this phone.",,,,
"There's always a problem on buying phones at a super cheap rate online because they sell faulty pieces. I bought at 38k but had to replace the fingerprint sensor within two weeks. Anyway, a good deal. Flipkart should be loyal and honest to its customers who count on it.",,,,
At first I was afraid to buy an iPhone from this seller after reading so many negative reviews.. First I ordered Iphone7 plus but reading so many negative reviews I cancelled the order.. I again after two week ordered Iphone 7 .though delivery was late by one day but as far as product is concerned I don't find anything wrong or missing... Its working fine so far... I dint want to review it... But I am happy with the product so I thought I should write... Don't flow in negative reviews...,,,,
"Fast delivery by Ekart
Excellent mobile in best Deal ,no other site gives you enough discount like Flipkart
Buy iphone from flipkart only",,,,
