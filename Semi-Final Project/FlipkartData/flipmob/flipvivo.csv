EXCELLENT DEAL! GOT THIS FOR 43390 ON BBD! THANK YOU FLIPKART!,,,,
"I buy this one on this Diwali at a discount price of 50k. The RetailNet was the seller and their packaging and delivery were good. After using this one for almost one month I decided to write a review of this product.
Pros
1) The best battery life I ever saw on a laptop. I am a software developer and this laptop clearly gives me 8-9 hours of battery life on continuous web surfing in chrome and programming. Really impressed and I only need to charge it at morning and it last all day. The ch...",,,,
A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.,,,,
"Its the latest MacBook air model (128GB) and imported in India in August 2017. Its enthralling to use it. The performance is glitch free.
Do buy if you are looking for a sleeky laptop.",,,,
"I have bought this product from Flipkart for 43,500/- on big billion day sale. this is an amazing product. 100% Genuine
Macbook air is an amazing laptop for college going students. This is not a gaming laptop as its metal body heats up quickly.
Otherwise, the specs will support all games and applications fairly. But they won't do justice to the quality or Fps.
Battery backup is amazing.
The Camera is awesome.
Boot time is negligible.
But MacXOS doesn't support many applications. So if you are...",,,,
The product is Good. but flipkart call center people are adamant.Name mentioned on invoice is incorrect I asked them to correct the same.As it was Flipkart mistake for providing improper name to vendor I raised a complain which was cleared without even having a word with me.I am very much dissatisfied by Flipkart approach towards my case,,,,

"Initially, I loved this laptop when I bought it. Then later, I found that there were a lot of software related hiccups to it, and that the OS crashed once or twice. This worried me and I almost tried to return it and get a refund on it or sell it as a second hand piece. But I took it to the service centre, and this laptop has improved its performance after the software update to High Sierra was made. This gives me hope about Apple. I believe that there will be better quality and performance o...",,,,
"Bought this from Flipkart in the beginning of the Big Billion Days sale 2017 for just rs44900. Price shot upto 50k soon after that. One of the best deals ever.

I have been eyeing this macbook for the past 6 months and waited till this Big billion day. Big billion day offer was just amazing. The cost of this macbook is around 58990. I bought it for a discount of flat 13000 + 1500 on Sbi card. Ensure that Flipkart assured tag is there before checking out.,,,,
"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.
I'm a software engineer and I have a company issued MacBook Pro 15"" late 2016, I wanted a MacBook which I could use for my personal tasks...",,,,

Hope Flipkart understand and solve the issue at earliest.",,,,
Definitely one of the better laptops I have purchased. I have been using windows since the beginning and by beginning I mean windows 98 version. But am amazed by the ease of use of Mac os X. Contrary to the popular belief it's easy to use and surely very stable. The macbook air is very sleek and sturdy. It's been made to last. An enjoying working on it and will recommend it my friends.,,,,

"Bought the macbook for the first time.
When i opened it i felt in love with the design and the quality is superb.I feel like a child as i have no idea how to operate a mac os. Mac os is easy to operate and the trackpad is simply WOW.

"MacBook Air does not need any review, It's awesome as ever. Got it at a price of 48K, it's a steal deal at this price.
MacBook air is powerful enough to do the daily chores with style and ease. Browsing in Safari is smooth and a never felt experience for windows user like me. Working in development environment like Eclipse, Android studio is smooth. If one has to use a laptop for any type of works other than graphic intensive gaming and extensive video editing, this laptop is more than adequ...",,,,

"One word Worthy
MacBook boot time and apps launches pretty quickly because of SSD. Processor is quite fast and keyboard haptic feedback is great, backlit light bleed is very less. Battery performance top notch.
One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen.",,,,

Final verdict 5 start :)",,,,
Good,,,,
"I am writing this review after 8 days and really mesmarized about this product. Very thin and light. If you are a windows user then most certainly you would find some difficulty in Mac OS.

Regarding delivery, delivered my product before the said date. I bought two same laptop for me and for my spouse.",,,,

"I am a developer and I've been using this for 2 months now. Its fantastic.
I had a wrong impression about macbook air that its just for business purposes not for heavy programming use but believe me I found my self completely wrong when I started using this machine.

I am holding windows machine with 8gb ram and more powerful processor than MacBook Air but that windows machine performance is not comparable to this as MacBook Air beats in eve...",,,,
