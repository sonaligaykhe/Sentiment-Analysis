My first xiaomi device makes me fully satisfied,,,,
Since I bought Redmi Note 4 .64GB Indian unit the phone is behaving well.Until I took a snap from the phone.Camera is as bad as one can imagine.However screen is again disappointing. Redmi should have come with Amoled Screen.I suppose RAM is not given properly which was supposed to give.I have a micromax juice 2 handset which has almost 15 apps.Still it is showing only 40-45% of RAM used.I uninstalled almost all preloaded apps from the Note 4 (4GB) unit.Still it is showing 50% RAM used. I thi...,,,,
Good value for money,,,,
"Looks are a stunning. Charging time is higher compare to other. Black 64 GB is the best option .
Screen brightness is still need to be improved .
Memory card option with two sim not possible but that is not required if we opt for 64 GB. Approx 52 GB and 2 GB ram is available . Speaker is in bottom not back side which is good.
Overall keeping in mind of 13000 rs it's not a bad option. In fact it's a very good option.

This is your duty to tell each and every of your buyers to tell the exact conditions.. specifically related to any china made product..
The phone.. which I had purchased from flipkart , one of my most worst deal in past 3 yrs.
I am really sorry to using these words..as it may hamper the confidence of some of your buyers but.. this is my mental dilemma.. to tell you that..

"This Phone is Quite Good as Usability. But it's back is Quite Slippery. Phone speed is awesome as per my usage.
But there is one thing i hated the most about Note 3 and This is also repeated in Note 4 is it's proximity sensor, this device's proximity sensor is wakeup.at anytime on call and by touch of face any call is made or Mute or Hold that call. This is Very Bad thing about this phone.",,,,
"Specification wise- very good..
But not good for calling.... Voice clarity is not good while calling...
Alternate solution- You have to use headphone for calling Which is not possible for every calls....
Bad experience...",,,,
"Dear MI,
It is for you information that i m using your phone last 10 days and observe the following issue.
1. It takes 5 to 6 Hour to charge 100%
2. Voice quality is very bad always singal break at the time of calling.
3. Screen pixel is too bad with your commitment i.e 401ppi my asus zenfone 2 laser has only 267 ppi but this is better than your​ 401 ppi
4. At the time of charging its gonna heat up like iron, you can boil water with this phone",,,,
