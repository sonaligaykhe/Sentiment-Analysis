NICE PHONE.,,,,
This is the best <20K phone you can have. The black colour is too good and is a piece of beauty. It holds good in your hand and feels like a premium. The screen is very clear and crisp. And most important of all it supports Samsung Pay. So in the coming future we dont need to carry our credit cards in our pocket. We can use the phone to make the payment at POS. This is the main reason i bought this phone.,,,,
great phone. it is better than j7 max because it has super amoled display with Samsung processor which better than mediateck and display is better than TFT display. colours a awesome in amoled display.please go for it.,,,,

"First time I went for a Samsung mobile & it is worth buying. Superb looks, as metal finish gives it a premium feel & descent internal setup at this price. Go for it. You will not get disappoint.. Thanks!! flipkart for the best class service.. Keep it up!!",,,,
Mobile is nice keeping features in mind..awesum camera..a liitle bit heavy ...faced some heating issue when compared with j7 max ...biggest pblm i faced was mobile is not getting geo internet conectivity in a particular area where everyone is getting connectivity...,,,,
Not the best product from Samsung... It could be better... J7max is a better option,,,,
"Phone is very good. The only feature missing is the LED notification since its very handy to remind about notifications. The battery is really good but the phone can be slippery sometimes so best to get a back cover quickly.
Flipkart delivery was as scheduled and no problems with packaging!",,,,
"Definitely recommendable phone.
Packaging and Delivery was Impressive.. as it was delivered well before the expected date.
Amazing piece of work by samsung. Handy device with Brilliant Display and really fine cameras with favourable battery backup for a whole day supporting all the stuff that you ought to do on the phone.
Front flash and Samsung pay is a plus which gives an edge among other rivals.
Happy to have purchased this at Flipkart.
Lets see how good it holds on the long run.",,,,
Just brilliant...what a premium look this device has! Awesome display .,,,,
"Excellent product.. Please buy without hesitation..
Even i wanted to ensure my new phone should not laggard or slow down..
But J7 Pro gives an excellent response even when you may have 15 apps open..
Never found let down even once..
3gb ram is enough.. But 4gb is the best you shud buy.. Which maybe the only drawback..
Rest, outstanding phone..",,,,
Phone is superb camera and battery are all good in love wid Samsung phone.. I got this phone within 2 working days thanks to flipkart.,,,,
Phone is absolutely superb. But the packing was not good. Scratches in cover.,,,,

Believe me Samsung J7 pro has answer to all of this. Its the best smart phone that has almost all the virtues samsung has to offer. Go n grab it, u won't repend. N thanks to flipkart for next day delivery.Flipkart n Samsung rocks!",,,,
Don't buy this mobile. It performed well at the beginning. But now the wifi and Bluetooth was not working suddenly. While charging the mobile gets more heat and battery drains very fast. At the beginning the mobile had good battery backup. I think they used very worst chipset. It will worth your money for few days only. Finger print sensor was irritating. Go for other mobiles.,,,,
"Superb and faster delivery by flipkart , everything as per specification , perfect design and metal body. Camera excellant, performance wise good i.e.90%, some times gets slow it might be because of after purchasing phone not receive any software update. Expecting update will receive. Battery last for full day with using 4g and to charge battery from 0 to 100% will take 2.30 hrs. Final verdict excellant smartphone by samsung go for it if you want to purchase samsung brand. J7 pro rocks....",,,,
Good Phone. Nice Delivery by flipkart intially the phone wch I recieved was heating more so i raised same issue with c'care. But as it is good replacment policy with flipkart i got another replaced phone of same model. Now new phone running well. Overall good experience with j7 pro n Flipkart.,,,,
"Very poor quality phone! Though we get all sensors at this price point, we end up getting very poor UI. Phone is extremely lagu.",,,,
"Quick Delivery by Flipkart after a long time. Usually they take 4-5 working days.
Samsung J7 PRO is really AWESOME.... Best and better than the rest. Good Features, latest android, Best Camera aperture (1.7) . DO NOT GO FOR PIXELS, look for the aperture.. NO OTHER BRAND CAN MATCH THIS 1.7 aperture.
Overall the phone is very good. Last but not the least....
This is my FIRST SAMSUNG phone.. And I am very Happy with J7 PRO.",,,,
1 star for flipcart... Cheat me.. Didn't give 10% discount on SBI card...stars for display..4 stars camera...5 stars for battery...5 stars for finger print censor...Too fast..5 stars for gane launcher...But not value for money....Other company provides more extra features in same price range...Like camera features...etc,,,,
"Very Good product.
Very poor experience. The Courier even did not call me one time. I have to collect their contact number from the website, then I have to call them. even I told them to give extra charges to give the item to my home but they refuse. Very poor experience. I have to go their office to the item. DONT SEND ITEMS WITH THIS TYPE COURIOR .",,,,
