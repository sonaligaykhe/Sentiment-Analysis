Nice one awesome phon,,,,
Lovely mobile.Just mindblowing,,,,
"This phone from Nokia is amazing. The camera, speed, durability, looks. Just too good. Yeah, little heavily priced. Needed a longer battery life. Nokia is back!
'v'",,,,
"Amazing come back by Nokia. Pocket friendly beast. Camera is nice, its better to use manual mode. Not a huge display that's much better to carry around. Bezel you won't notice much while working with your phone as it does all its task seamlessly. Android 8.1 update last week rolled out as promised by Nokia it got delivered onto this phone. All and all a very nice purchase.",,,,
Excellent mobile,,,,
"Amazingly bright and vibrant screen. Yes its an LCD but quite punchy and bright. Watching videos is the highlight.
Battery is good. Which in today's world means it shall last a day.
Camera is good. But the focus is slow. This isn't that big a problem during the day, but a pain in low light conditions.
The finger print scanner isn't as snappy as, let's say, on One Plus.
There is ghosting. Especially in the night mode. It is quite prominent while scrolling text in night mode.
Build quality...",,,,
Best phn wver used best in everything as usual nokia means quality .but it tilts get pretty hot around 39 to 41 degree Celsius.,,,,
"Battery Back up could've been better but its still worth at 27k. Slightly gets Heated when heavy usage like watching 4k videos but it cools down pretty quick too.
Overall Satisfied",,,,
A good phone,,,,

"Everything is superb.. build to camera to speed to portability... everything worth the price.. just the battery heats up a lot to like 36-40Â°C. And the ram is not 4gb its 3.6gb , didnt liked the finger print medium provided could have used a button like samsung would have produced much better experience ... But No complains its worth the price of 27K ... ordered it from Omnitech on 13th march 2:45pm received on 16th march 1:30pm ..till now everything seems to be working superb",,,,
