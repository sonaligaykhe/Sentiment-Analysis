Why didnt you handed over the wall mounting accessories which is always coming with tv itself. Do it immediately,,,,

"The product seems to be good with reasonable picture quality. However, Panasnic does not provide wall mounting bracket. This bracket as per Panasonic manual is an 'optional accessory'!

"Addition to my previous feed back:
This is a poor Television from Panasonic with poor support from Flipkart. It doesn't have any impressive features to be called a Smart TV.
I will suggest not to buy any Panasonic TV. Now mirroring function is not working. I called Panasonic customer care and no support from them.
I have received the item on 17th Oct 2017.
Box is not opened yet. Installation is pending till now 21 Oct 2017.

"Wonderful tv, the inputs 3 hdmi good. I connected the wireless mouse and keyboard thru usb. Could use it On opera browser which is inbuilt but with some limitations, the mouse though worked fine. The volume 20 watts though not great but is adequate and quality does not deteriorate on max volume. Clarity remains.

"A fantastic full hd smart tv from one of the top brands in much affordable price. I got it under 34k from Flipkart under sale.
Image quality is superb. Audio output is also clear and nice. Screen mirroring works smoothly. In apps, only You tube is an inbuilt app, which works perfect. Only finding the video through keyboard is a pain.
If you want a branded full hd smart tv in affordable price range, just go for this !!
Also, appreciate support from flipkart for delivery and installation. Bo...",,,,
"So far the TV is working great.. Great picture quality and good sound quality. Supports almost all the formats via usb including the newly evolved format which is hevc/x265 10 bit. However, as far as smart features are concern only YouTube and screen mirroring are available",,,,

Nice TV in low price. Delivery and installation was fast. I am yet to test Smart functions. You tube requires registration/login. Don't know why screen is blank when you open youtube function.,,,,
"Value for money.. good features, best sound, made in india.",,,,
"Well keeping aside all the so and so reviews, the flipkart's service was very good...
The product is the basic model among SmartTVs sold by Panasonic... It has Opera TV OS at its heart... Picture quality is very good... Full HD pictures are worth watching in this TV...Sound quality is also very good as it incorporates DTS surround sound technology.
If you have high speed internet connection then you can enjoy many features of Opera TV... But don't expect as much as you expect from Android O...",,,,
Not a single indian app is present in the tv. All the apps are uk based or Japanese. Customer support also don't know much about the tv.,,,,

Not happy with the demo. The installation service engineer took the screws and other stuff which came along with the unit.,,,,
"Superb purchase..........Best in this price range..... Delivered on promised date...... Installed on next day.......No hasselles yet........
Just go for it......
I'm not giving details of functioning...... Because each aspect of this TV seems best in this price range..... Because sony the best brand will cost at least 1.5 times to this one.....
Don't think a second ......Go for it.
Now last thing about flipkart is that they are becoming more reliable for larger purchase as compared to small...",,,,

Now it is communicated that the resolution will be done by 8th Nov but it is not written any where that the installation guys would be coming or not.. This is really frustrating..,,,,
"I ordered this TV after some research and in my budget deal. I even got 3 offers on 10000/- off on Selling price of 47,000/- and Rs 550/- on my old CRT Phillips 21 inch TV. There was also HDFC No Cost EMI of 3/6/9 months which was a great deal to me. Now coming to delivery of product, Flipkart is too good in that and it came on 4th Oct morning as expected. On 6th October, the installation partner Jeeves person came and wall mounted on it. However, the Jeeves service person should have patienc...",,,,
