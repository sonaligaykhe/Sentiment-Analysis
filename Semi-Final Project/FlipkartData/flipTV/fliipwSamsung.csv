Customer support service is really pathetic. I orderd the Samsung full HD TV on 8th of Oct 2017 but till now(1st Dec 2017) didn't get any support on installation part whereas I was promised to do the installtion within 5 days post delivery. I tried to contact Flipkart customer care many a times but didn't get any support. I never expected such kind of response from Flipkart whereas Customer support should be on top priority in today's world. Now onwards I will give it a second thought before ...,,,,
Very bad experience with Samsung.Still waiting for the installation. It's already one month completed.,,,,
"Flipkart service and support is very bad.The product was delivered on 3rd October but Flipkart hasn't arranged installation yet.
Now about Samsung TV, it's a good product picture quality sound overall good but screen mirroring is not supporting with my Moto g5 plus .",,,,
"Only the dialogues/speech between characters sound normal in t.v. viewing.
Audio from t.v. speakers is not immersive enough for tv viewing, as even normal music in t.v. programmes, and movie songs sounds average.
Also only two HDMI ports are there. Non on the sides, both are at the back side of t.v.
Display quality seems good though.",,,,
"Good display but doesn't support .mkv format or any video above 30fps. It's NOT a smart TV. Bad bad speakers. Very low sounding and it's fascinating how they make the bass disappear. I had to buy a separate sound system after I got this TV. It's kind of like you get what you paid for. So yeah, go for a bit costlier ones.",,,,
Product is excellent. Flipkart delayed the delivery and did not have the courtesy to inform it.,,,,
I ordered this TV on 15 th night 9.30 and Flipkart delivered this product very next day before 1 pm.Installation completed by Samsung's person within 24 hrs. Smart functions are not working for my Moto G 5 plus and Moto E . Please don't buy this product if you are expecting mobile mirroring with motorla phones. Audio mirroring working fine with motorla phones. Screen mirroring will work on higher end phones. I tried with one plus 3t in that case it's working. Video quality is fine,,,,
"Picture Quality is good but audio is really average. No surround and true sound options in menu under sound category. Hence its only normal sound and speakers are weak compared to 3 year old Smart led tv from samsung. Disappointed.
Dont buy this one for elderly as u will definitely need a speakers for them. A 2.1 speaker set is advisable as there is no thump nor bass even when u watch HD channels or content. So whats the use of having a full HD display along with dolby atmos setttings from t...",,,,
Good Product. I bought this product on 9th August. Got the product delivered on the 11th August. I have been using this product since 12th August. I have no complaints to be made against this product so far. Though i have not used basic smart features. HD viewing is good. Overall this is the best product for budget people.,,,,
Fabulous quality and value for money. I always received high quality and authentic products from Flipkart. Good work.,,,,

"Product is good but it's basic smart function not working on all mobile brand . Support only few .. build quality not as expected with Samsung . Picture quality good . My opinion buy another brand like VU & LG , Kodak & cloud tv if u want to buy a smart TV & if u buy a branded company box than u can buy it . Seriously think before buy it . Flipkart not provide all specification with this item . Go with another brand in this price range . I have very bad experience .",,,,
Worst build quality,,,,
"It's a good value product. Good picture and sound quality.
Flipkart delivered the product within 24 hrs. and the product was installed the day after by the Samsung sernice engineer.
Over all quite satisfactory.",,,,
Great led tv.I got it within 3 days at a price of â‚¹24099 after exchanging my old crt tv..Picture quality is good.Bass is low like other tv.It has audio mirroring which we can connect mobile.I could connect my xiaomi mobile with the tv.I had installed the tv on stand when i got it.The Samsung engineer come to install with wall mount within 48 hours. I much liked it and thanks to Samsung and Flipkart.,,,,
"The TV is very good with smart sharing features like screen cast and Bluetooth. The resolution is good, panel is full HD, really immersive with narrow bezels. There is a 3.5mm/optical combo audio out port.
The only downside is that the refresh rate is just 50hz which could have been 75hz for more smooth experience.
The screen mirror needs improvement, it works well with my Doogee mix but there are some issues like lag and stutter with redmi 4 and redmi note 4.
I also read in a previous review...",,,,
Clarity of TV is good but additional features like Bluetooth audio and mobile to tv share feature not working for Pixel and Nexus mobiles ... very disappointing ... Services of Samsung also bad ..... have been following up for 5 days now,,,,
"Flipkart probuct delivery is awesome and they know how to treat a customer ... basic smart samsung 32m5100 is a good tv & the quality of picture just mind blowing when u watch hd chanel your viewing experience just awesome. .... but the sound quality of the tv are not so good ....

"My review is for flipkart #
I bought this smart tv and after installation with samsung expert got to know some it's not fully smart,looking for refund to buy fully smart as 8 have enough budget where as flipkart is not agreeing this is not good.
Where is customer satisfaction .",,,,
"Product is very good, but Flipcart cheated with me as it was boost EMI, but later it changed to Interest @14%",,,,
"First of all, i was disappointed with the delivery speed by flipkart this time. Ordered the product on sunday and it was not even packed till thursday afternoon! After dozens of calls to flipkart, my product was shipped and reached me by Saturday morning. The packing was good and the product's quality was good. Samsung's installation speed was really amazing as my tv was installed 2 hours after the delivery! The picture quality is amazing and the wifi connectivity is also good. If you want a ...",,,,
"Solo viewing does not work on all smartphones. It's only for high-end device like Samsung galaxy s6 s7, i had to buy a Bluetooth headset for solo viewing. Should have mentioned in the description. It deceiving they are not telling everything.",,,,
Service ok but we didn't found wall mounting bracket inside the TV box which was mentioned during time booking.,,,,
Poor sound quality.. smart basic is nothing.. please buy a smart Tv for this price. It is not a smart TV. Just that you can project/cast your mobile on the tv screen.,,,,
"Paid 24k which was Money worth for a full HD basic smart. Sound quality, picture quality are good. Perfect for wall mount. Only disadvantage i found is HDMI ports are at back side. It will be difficult to connect when you have wall mounted the tv. It would have been helpful if those were also given at sides like usb ports.",,,,
"Please Dont buy this TV. its 100% fake.
1. Screen mirroring doesn't supported all model of mobiles. Be aware of this...
2. TV sound to Mobile doesn't working. Only it will supported on Samsung mobiles, which is having Quick connect supported.
3. Picture not that much Great...now days an Normal HD TV give more clarity and more color.
4. Sound is very low, you should have External Speakers...
Earlier i thought of Buy Panasonic, just the products features (on Samsung website) and impressed. ...",,,,
"What is the mean of basic smart?, Screen mirroring is not supported by all phone,it want only premium android phone.above all sound quality is very poor. wastage of money in tha name of sound or screen mirroring.",,,,
