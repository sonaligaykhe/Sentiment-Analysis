TCL tv was good but for installation TCL representative said that they will charge Rs 1000 which was never mentioned by Flipkart he also told that Flipkart supplier is not authorized dealer so I am also worried about the 3 years warranty given by Flipkart while purchasing TV & Flipkart representative was also not able to give any satisfactory answer. Overall very bad experience.,,,,

Only installation get some time. Rest all good.,,,,
