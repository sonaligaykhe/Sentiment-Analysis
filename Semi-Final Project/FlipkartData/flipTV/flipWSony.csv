To discuss about this product
Pros:
looks great in its segment.
Great sound output 20w, no other TV in its segment is giving this much output.
Cons:
Price
Design ( neither sleek nor stylish)",,,,
"seems like good for budget. But some issue still persist
1. Heating on right side of LED panel
2. Not support all videos like .webm or some time .mp4 .
3.Play back functionality is very slow ,if you use any external device like pen drive or hard disk.",,,,
Perfect brand new product with warranty card and invoice. But the product is 1 star levelled below the screen...it was not mentioned anywhere. Delivered in 2 days. Qurier man did not deliver to home...asked me to take it from his place 10km away from my home. And he was rude. Also sony installation man installed it within 5 mins...did not show any demo. But quality of the product is perfect and thanks to seller and flipkart.,,,,
After reading lot of reviews I bought it.This is my first led tv.. picture quality is good and sound quality is excellent in my dd free dish.price is little high as compare with others but thanks to big billion sale. Overall tv is superb.Must go for it..,,,,

"Radio dosent work as per demo engineer said.
Sound is not good.
Some video extensions doesn't support.
Demo engineer hasn't good knowledge. He doesn't know option about sony tv. He came because of warranty coupon.",,,,
"This product deserve ''ZERO"" rating because being a top-most brand in television and having price above Rs.10000/- this model does not support '' MP4 '' Which is an essential part of L.E.D ,While mostly all the L.E.D. available in market have this feature on conclusion .... It is worst product,should not be bought by anybody.",,,,
"Nice product, picture and sound quality is excellent, worth for 12.5K.
Installation was done on time...but guy asked for money for installation for buying online.
But we denied him...finally installed free of cost.",,,,
"Do not buy this model. There is an audio issue. After 8-9 hours of viewing this tv the audio suddenly goes off, you will have to restart the tv to get back the audio. Have been chasing Flipkart & Sony for this issue but as this issue happens suddenly after tv is on for few hours it does not happen in front of their technician thus they don't believe me. Finally have made a video of the problem hope they believe now! But do not buy.",,,,
"Thanks to Flipkart, Good TV I got within Rs 14500, delivered within time. I have been using it for one week. Without my intervention (arranged by Flipkart) Technician from Sony came and installed next day.
Pros:
1. Brand Bravia by Sony
2. Sound is charming. I played original mp3 songs via USB it surprised me. The reason I fell in love with my TV.
3. HD content plays smoothly
4. Very light, can carry easily
5. HDMI, USB ports are on left side, not in back side
6. Much options to customize your...",,,,
"Bought this TV a week back for 2 offers combined and cost was 12800. Delivered in a day and I called the Sony customer care immediately after receiving. The installation (the Wall mount is free) and Demo was free which was done on the next day. So, No delays in delivery and installation.",,,,

"'It is a 'Sony' - A great product. Excellent picture and sound quality. Light weight and easy to use. Ideal 2nd TV for viewing in bed room during winter.
Very reasonable price of 13.5 K, about 2K less than market price. Good packing and prompt delivery. Follow up visit by Sony Engr for installation and demo within 2 days, as promised (athough we used our own swivel and turn wall mount in place of a fixed type received free from Sony). Delighted with our purchase experience with Flipkart.",,,,

Very bad,,,,
Don't buy this product on flipkart.,,,,
Flipkart delivered within 4 or 5 days...... Nice Led.... Suitable for bedroom...... But the main problem with it was...... It doesn't support most of the video formats when connected through USB........it hardly supports 1 or 2 video formats.......I didn't expect this from Sony..... As it being the top Brand..... Such product they manufactured....,,,,
"The audio-out port works only when one accessory is connected. For example, in my case, either the external speaker, or the earphone, not both at the same time. When both are connected through a splitter cable, neither works. When either one is connected through the splitter cable, or directly to the port, it works. I have another larger Sony TV, on which the splitter cable works both these accessories. I asked Flipcart. They arranged for Sony or their service agents to call me, but, whe...",,,,
Tv is sound less .. very poor quality.. To bad,,,,
The product is very good(for product i gave 5 star) but the service of flipkart is really bad. Its more than 13 days but no one came for installtion. I have complained many times but every time they give new promise date and regret about previous one. Their promise failed many time.,,,,
