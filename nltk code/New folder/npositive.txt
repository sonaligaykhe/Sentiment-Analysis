Excellent phone.Performance: it is very beautifully balanced between speed and stability,no app crashes and less load timeI played dead trigger,asphalt, critical ops with out any lag.Battery : is just amazing ,it lasts a say without breaking a sweatHeat: it doesn't heat.sounds quality is far superior then others phone within this range.Camera quality is very good and u will not find front 8mp with flash in this range.Though processor is not Snapdragon but it is ok display quality is far better.additional key for music is differentiate among all phones in this range.
No heating issue noticed till now.Depth mood is awesome in this price range.And I love the Stock Android experience.Camera is very very very bad, remaining all is ok.Very nice phone.This phone is good under 6999, but not the best,,the 13 mp rear camera only for name,but like 5 mp,battery is very good, overall performance of this phone is good but camera is disappointing guys.Good phone in this range. Awesome battery life. Phone doesn't heat even after playing heavy games.Thank you very happyCall quality is bad, may due to mic problem. The Opposite person hears very less volume.

Absolute lag-less experience. No issues with performance at all. Fluidic switching between apps (even games). Amazing fingerprint scanner (To be very frank, I've tested OnePlus3 too; and I found Z2 Plus is faster. 
Gets faster as you keep using it). Sound output through 3.5mm jack is just crystal clear. For an Audiophile like me, Treble output was decent, Bass was amazing. The Speaker was decent enough; easily heard in outside crowd conditions (Although I rarely use the speakers). UHealth app works fairly accurately, Pedometer sensor is pretty good. U-Touch option is one of its kind (Best feature) The 4G speeds on this is just amazing. (Apparently, I found that its always active on the 4G bandwidth so whenever I switch on data it displays all the messages instantly). The charging rate is pretty fast too, takes around 2hr 15mins on an average to charge.
5 inch form-factor is wonderful, and just what I wanted. Looks like an iPhone Jet Black series due to the backside glass. Double Tap to wake is an awesome feature . Superb Phone. loved it. Satisfied with Performance and Appearance. Best in this price range. Thanks to flipkart for the offers. Excellent screen, compact size, fast n furious, good sound, Mind blowing battery back up. This freaking unbelievable in today's date you getting Snapdragon 820 2.15 GHz processor with finger print ahhh that may not be unique feature for u but getting packed with 3500mah battery hellyeah it has type c bundled with quick charger 3.0 which give 1.5 HR to 100% power plus due to 5 inch display phone last long to more than a day with normal use clicking phone pics using snapchat WhatsApp n few games all connected to 4g LTE too..
plus giving 441 ppi display with vivid colours yeah now that makes phone worth buying don't think much I must add there is no heating or lagging due to such powerful processor!Under this price... Go for it ! Phone design is too good It's looks like sony xperia z and the processing is very fast. and nice battery back up Picture quality is also very good. Decent camera at this price range .low light camera little bit less. Battery performance good not bad it gives 1 day normal use charge..little bit heating on charging otgerwise ok.. video call facility is as of now not there may b in update u get. performance wise good. And finger print sensor also work really well... Overall rating 4/5..

No heating.....A AWESOME DISPLAY .......ONE OF THE BEST LOOK in the world...and that Curved glass is just oh mah godddd.......WORTH EACH AND EVERY PENNY..... LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LET ME PRESENT YOU THE BEST PHONE OF THE YEAR- REDMI NOTE 41. Performance - its best in class, its budget phone but you will be surprised how smooth it is when its performs, performance got even better after i updated it (yes, you can update it with new MIUI system stability update right after you unbox your device and use it for first time.) *****update - using it as my daily driver with my primary gmail acc, installed almost 100 apps, no issue or bugs, some hiccups with nova launcher but its not device problem, hope devs can fix it. 2. design - its best in class, you can feel in hand that it is premium product. *****update - applied screen protector and ipaky cover, now its heavy but still premium, look for covers and screenguard at ebay , good deals and perfect fit for phone. 3. Battery life - As Mi compared it to pixel and iphone 7, im not saying it's bad but i'm really getting over 5 to 6 Hours of SOT with high usage. So its really Got a good battery life. *****update - still getting over 5 hours of SOT, avg 4.5 to 5.2 hours.4. Screen - its a 1080p IPS panel, similar to redmi note 3, but its more richer and colours are more Brighter on Note 4, make sure you use a screen guard on it or be careful with the screen :). *****update - make sure u apply a screen guard :) 5. Connectivity - Device comes with all standard features Like 4G Volte, BT 4.1,Wifi etc , no issues with Jio or any other 4g network Provider. *****update - i found device gets hot if u use jio constantly like when you watching full hd videos on youtube or make video calls, but later i found its bcoz jio4gvoice app, make sure u kill other apps at background during standby mode, use apps like greenify.. 6. Camera - i took some Pics on day light and night time, few with low lights, after using every mods and custom apps with custom settings , i can say that its a good camera, not the best camera , but its better then most of the other budget devices and really better then redmi 3s prime and redmi note 3. *****update - camera is good not the best, no issues while using it. 7. No heating issue - i'm using this device now for 3 days, and i didn't faced any heating issue normally , i played games (clash of clans and clash royale which are power and connection hungry) for like 2 hours straight and it did got heat up at back panel near camera and mid section , but its got cooled down in few minutes,and there was no lag or performance issues while i was playing those games. *****update - it does gets hot only if u use in ultra mode like watching full hd videos constantly in 4g network or play intense gfx games for longer period, rest of the time its always stays cool. 8. Double tap to wake up - you guys know already its a good feature, its gonna be more awesome if we can double tap to make screen off :D. also they added some nice gesture like pressing volume buttons wakes the device, volume down twice will launch camera, also many cool gesture are available in MIUI like 3 finger swipe for screenshot etc. *****update - enjoying it.Excellent
